Music genre classification using mfcc's

In this notebook I want to classify music from 10 different genres. The input data is the GTZAN Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andradaolteanu/gtzan-dataset-music-genre-classification), which contains 100 30s exerpts for 10 diffenrent genres. For each exerpt mfcc vectors are calculated, which are used as input data for the machine learning algorithms.

The mapping of the labels: 0: "hiphop", 1: "blues", 2: "rock", 3: "jazz", 4: "disco", 5: "metal", 6:"classical", 7: "pop", 8: "country", 9: "reggae"
