Music genre classification using mfcc's

In this notebook I want to classify music from 10 different genres. The input data is the GTZAN Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andradaolteanu/gtzan-dataset-music-genre-classification), which contains 100 30s exerpts for 10 diffenrent genres. For each exerpt mfcc vectors are calculated, which are used as input data for the machine learning algorithms.
